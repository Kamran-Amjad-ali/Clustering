Positive and negative reviews of hotels - Clustering

First, I found 29 urls for fetching the reviews of different hotels available on Kayak. I then scraped them into seperate files based on their polarity (Positive and Negative). 

The zipped folder "Neg_.zip" contains the negative files and the "Pos_.zip" contains the positive files. "cluster.py" is used to fetch the reviews and saving them into text files. "cluster_next.py" is used to consolidate these reviews into one and use it for clustering and other things.
